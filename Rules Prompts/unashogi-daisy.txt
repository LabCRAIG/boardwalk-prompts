3. Gameplay
    - Turn order: Players alternate, taking one action per turn. Player 1 starts.
    - Valid player actions: During a turn, a player must do one of three things:
    - place a piece from the reserve on a free space on the board
    - move a previously placed piece to a free space
    - move a piece to a space occupied by an opposing piece, capturing it.
        
        A player may not make a capture until their own a or A is on the board.
        
    - Piece characteristics:
        - A, a: moves one space in any direction
        - B, b: moves any number of spaces orthogonally, so long as all spaces are free

        - D, d: moves one square in any direction except diagonally backwards
        - E, e: moves one square diagonally or one square forward orthogonally

        - G, g: moves any number of spaces only orthogonally forward
        - H, h: moves one space forward orthogonally
    - Win/loss conditions: Player 1 wins if they capture the a. Player 2 wins if they capture the A.
4. Additional rules
    
    When a player captures an opposing piece, they add it to their reserve as an instance of their piece type equivalent to the one captured (e.g. if Player 1 captures a b, they gain a B).
    
    “Forward” means upward for the uppercase pieces and downard for the lowercase pieces. The opposite is true for “backwards”.
