4. Additional rules
    
    During the second phase, if the moved piece causes an opponent’s piece to be sandwiched between it and another of the acting player’s pieces, then the opponent’s piece is captured. It is possible to capture more than one piece this way, one piece per orthogonal direction.
    
    If a player is unable to make a move, they pass their turn and the opponent plays again.
